#### The Official Repository for the ESSAI 2023 Course

---

There are **2 things to be found** in this repository:

1. The lecture slides as `.pdf`. Simply go into `Lecture-Slides/`.
2. The Code Tutorial as `.ipynb` (Jupyter Notebook). Details on running the tutorial:
   * 1. Open a Google Colab session. 
     2. Select runtime "GPU" if wished. 
     3. Then add the remaining local files from the git repository to the runtime (otherwise the dependencies break). These files are the ones ending in `.py` and `.csv`.
     4. Then simply run and enjoy :heart_eyes:

Course is headed by Adèle Ribeiro (AR), Devendra Singh Dhami (DD) and Matej Zečević (MZ).
